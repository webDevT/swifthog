		<h1>TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE</h1>
		<div class="about__sub-text">
			(Effective Date: October 1, 2020)

		</div>

		<p>Welcome to <i><a href="SwiftHog.com">SwiftHog.com.</a></i> These Terms and Conditions of Use (<strong>“Terms of Use”</strong>) govern your use of the website, including any content, functionality, and services offered on or through the SwiftHog.com website (collectively, the <strong>“Website”</strong>), whether as a guest or registered user. SwiftHog, LLC (<strong>“SwiftHog,” “we,” “our,” or “us”</strong>) owns and operates the Website.
</p>

<p>You should also review the Website’s <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. The Privacy Policy explains our information collection practices, such as the types of information we collect regarding visitors to the Website and how we may use that information. BY ACCESSING OR USING THIS WEBSITE, YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS OF USE AND THE PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE PROVISIONS SET FORTH IN THESE TERMS OF USE OR THE PRIVACY POLICY, DO NOT USE THIS WEBSITE. By use of the Website, you affirm that you are at least 18 years of age and are fully able and competent to enter into the terms, conditions, obligations, affirmations, representations, and warranties set forth in these Terms of Use, and you agree to abide by and comply with these Terms of Use.
</p>

<p><strong>Locating Firearms for Purchase from Third Parties on this Website.</strong> SwiftHog does not sell firearms to individuals. Federal law prohibits the interstate sale of firearms to persons or entities that do not have a valid Federal Firearms License issued by the U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (“<strong>ATF</strong>”). Part of the Website’s functionality, however, provides a means for consumers to (i) search for a firearm that they are interested in purchasing, and (ii) arrange to complete the purchase and take physical possession of the firearm with a firearms dealer that has a Federal Firearms License who may sell firearms to legally authorized retail purchasers in compliance with all federal, state and local laws and regulations (a “<strong>Licensed Dealer</strong>”). Thus, although an individual cannot buy a firearm directly from SwiftHog, the Website allows an individual to select a firearm and arrange for the purchase of the firearm from a Licensed Dealer of his or her choice.
</p>

<p>Any reference to a Licensed Dealer, or any transaction arranged with such Licensed Dealer on this Website, does not constitute an endorsement or recommendation of that particular Licensed Dealer by us. None of the Licensed Dealers with which you may come into contact through the Website are within the control of SwiftHog, and we are not responsible in any manner for their policies or practices. If you have any questions concerning a Licensed Dealer, you should contact them directly, or contact your local law enforcement or regional ATF office listed in your local telephone directory.
</p>

<p><strong>Compliance with Federal, State and Local Laws.</strong> SwiftHog makes no covenant, warranty or representation that firearms and other products identified on the Website will conform to any federal, state or local laws, ordinances, regulations, codes or standards related to the sale and use of firearms. Firearms shown on the Website are not an offer to ship the firearm to any jurisdiction where its sale is prohibited by law. Because of legal restrictions, not all firearms listed on the Website are available for purchase in all areas. Also, attaching certain accessories to your firearm may render it prohibited in certain states and locales. It is the responsibility of you and the Licensed Dealer that you select to assure that your purchase and ownership of a firearm is made in compliance with all federal, state and local laws, ordinances, regulations, codes and standards. It is your responsibility to determine whether your state and local laws, ordinances, regulations, codes and standards allow you to install specific accessories on your firearm.</p>

<p>Firearms and certain other products identified on the Website have specific age restrictions with respect to ownership or use. These restrictions may be based on product specifications or your state of residence or delivery. Such products may be limited as to ownership or use by individuals who are at least 18 or 21 years of age. You hereby acknowledge and agree that it is your explicit responsibility to remain informed on any and all such restrictions that may apply to you.
</p>

<p><strong>Account Information and Registration.</strong> In order to have access to certain services on the Website, including, but not limited to, arranging for a firearm purchase through a Licensed Dealer, you may be required, or provided with the option, to create a SwiftHog.com account (“<strong>Account</strong>”). Whenever an Account is required to access functionality or services on the Website, you may not share your Account with, or use the Account of, another individual.</p>

<p>When creating an Account, you agree to provide accurate, current and complete information about yourself (“<strong>Registration Information</strong>”) as prompted by our account registration form. Registration Information may include, among other information, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, username, password, date of birth, and credit card information. You also represent that we may rely on your Registration Information and you agree to maintain and update your Registration Information to keep it accurate, current and complete. We reserve the right, in our sole and absolute discretion, to discontinue any requested process and/or to terminate your Account for inaccurate, untrue, deceptive and/or incomplete Registration Information.</p>

<p>With respect to any username that you create as part of the registration process, we may refuse to grant you the use of a username that, in our sole and absolute discretion, we deem to be inappropriate. Inappropriate usernames include, but are not limited to, usernames that are fashioned to impersonate another person, protected by copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights, vulgar or otherwise offensive, as well as those that may cause confusion or that are already in use. These are only some examples of inappropriate usernames and we reserve the right, at our own discretion, to deem any username invalid or inappropriate.</p>

<p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your username and password, for restricting access to your Account, and for any and all transactions, communications, and other activities that are conducted through your Account on the Website. You agree not to transfer, assign or sell your username and/or password, or otherwise provide access to the Website, through the disclosure and use of your username and password, to any third party. If you have reason to believe that your Account is no longer secure, you must promptly change your password and contact us.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Use of Third-Party Information and Websites.</strong> In addition to facilitating contact with Licensed Dealers, this Website contains links that you may use to access certain third-party websites. Such websites are not under our control, and we make no representations or warranties, express or implied, as to the accuracy of any of the information or material located on the other websites. The inclusion of a link to another website does not imply any recommendation or endorsement of, or affiliation with, the other website. When you leave SwiftHog.com and visit another website, we encourage you to first read the terms and conditions and the privacy policy of the new website, as your use of that website will be subject to the terms and policies applicable to it.

</p>

<p>
	In limited circumstances we allow advertisers (each, an “<strong>Advertiser</strong>”) to promote goods, services and other materials on the Website. Descriptions of, or references to, related products or publications within the Website do not imply endorsement of the product or publication by us.

</p>

<p>
	<strong>Comments and Submissions.</strong> You may submit comments and feedback by e-mail and through the Website’s Contact Us feature. From time to time the Website may provide other functionality to give you a means to express to us your opinions or share information, ideas, materials, photographs, and other content generated by you (each, together with any electronically submitted comments and feedback, a “<strong>User Submission</strong>”). You agree that you are solely responsible for any User Submission that you submit through the Website or directly to SwiftHog (including by e-mail). You warrant to SwiftHog that you own or otherwise control all rights necessary to provide each such User Submission made by you, and you covenant that, with respect to each such User Submission, (a) it will not contain your confidential information or any confidential information belonging to another; (b) it is accurate and will not cause injury to any person or entity; (c) you shall have all necessary rights and permission to make such submission; and (d) it does not infringe upon or violate the rights of any third parties, including, without limitation, any intellectual property rights, rights of publicity or privacy, or any other proprietary rights. You agree to indemnify SwiftHog for all claims resulting from any User Submission you supply. SwiftHog has the right, but not the obligation, to monitor and edit or remove any User Submission at our absolute discretion. SwiftHog takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Submission supplied by you or any third party.
</p>

<p>By making any User Submission (including by e-mail) you waive any claim or requirement that we maintain the User Submission in confidence or compensate you in any way for our use of all or any part of the User Submission. Furthermore, you grant to SwiftHog a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, and fully sub-licensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, perform, broadcast, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, display and otherwise exercise all rights in and to such submission, through the Website or otherwise, in any form, media, or technology now known or later developed, and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, you waive your moral rights in such User Submission.</p>
