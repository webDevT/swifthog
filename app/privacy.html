			Your privacy is very important to SwiftHog, LLC (“<strong>SwiftHog</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>, “<strong>us</strong>”, and “<strong>our</strong>”), and we take your right to privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy (the “<strong><a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a></strong>”) explains our privacy practices, including what type of information we collect, what we do with that information, and how we protect it. It also describes how you can access and update your information and privacy preferences. This Privacy Policy applies to information about users of our websites, <a href="www.swifthog.com"><strong>www.swifthog.com</strong></a> and (the “<strong>Website</strong>”), and its on-line features or services, as well as to personal information obtained when you call, email, or otherwise communicate or interact with SwiftHog or the Website. Our Websites and other services and communications, whether on-line or otherwise, are collectively referred to as “<strong>Services</strong>”.

		</p>

		<p>
			This Privacy Policy is part of the <a href="terms.html"><strong>Terms of Use</strong></a> of the Website, and by accessing or using the Website, you agree to be bound by all of its terms and conditions. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not access or use the Website.
		</p>

		<p>
			This Privacy Policy may change at any time, so please check it often. Such changes are effective immediately by posting the revised Policy on the Website. Your continued use of the Website after such modifications constitutes your acknowledgment of the modified Policy and your agreement to abide and be bound by the modified Policy.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>
				Website Use Forbidden for Children
			</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			Neither the Website nor any Services of SwiftHog are intended to be used by children under 18 years of age. No one under age 16 is eligible to use the Website. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16. If you are under 16, do not: (1) use or provide any information about yourself on the Website, (2) on or through any of its features, register on the Website, or (3) attempt to make any purchases through the Website. If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a person under the age of 16, we will delete that information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 16, please <a href=""><strong>contact us</strong></a>. Many of our products require you to be at least 18 or 21 years of age and if you enter into any online shopping transactions on the Website, you are representing to us that you are of legal age and have all necessary authority to enter into and bind yourself under any agreements made on the Website.

		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Information We Collect About You</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>
				In General.
			</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			By visiting the Website or using our Services through the Website or otherwise, we may collect personal information about you including your name, your status (such as whether you are a customer, dealer or media professional), mailing address, email address, title or occupation and telephone number. The types of personal information we collect and share depend on the service or interaction that you have with us (see “<strong>Personal Information</strong>” below for details).
		</p>

		<p>
			Personal Information that you provide and that we collect is obtained solely in the context of Services you engage either as a consumer or as an employee, owner, officer or contractor of a Federal Firearms License Dealer (“<strong>FFL Dealer</strong>”). We collect Personal Information from individual consumers who visit the Website as well as FFL Dealers who have established accounts on the Website. You may also visit the Website without identifying who you are or providing any personally identifiable information about yourself – that is information that specifically identifies a particular individual, such as name, address, or phone number. Many users of the Website will choose not to provide any personally identifiable information; therefore, those individuals are anonymous to us.

		</p>

		<p>
			When you visit the Website, whether or not you provide personally identifiable information, the Website captures certain common technical information automatically. This information may include your Internet protocol (IP) address, browser type and computer operating system, device type, application software, time and date you visit the Website, traffic patterns and usage data such as the pages you access, items you save to your cart, filters used in searches, the address of the third-party website that directed you to our Website or the third-party website you visit when you leave our Website. SwiftHog uses this information to understand patterns of site activity, including aggregated user demographics, and to improve the website so it is more useful to you. Although SwiftHog does not use or maintain any type of network activity or device information in a manner that identifies you, or that relates to, describes, or is reasonably capable of being associated with or linked to you or your household, some of this information may qualify as “<strong>Personal Information</strong>” or “<strong>Personal Data</strong>” under applicable law.

		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>
				Personal Information. 
			</strong>
		</p>

		<p>In addition to the contact information described above, SwiftHog may collect other personal information depending on the nature of your interaction with SwiftHog through the Website or any Services, including but not limited to:</p>

			<li>If you are applying for employment, your work authorization information, visa status, desired salary, academic level, employment history including salary, and any other information you include on the resume you upload to the Website. You may also choose to provide optional information such as race, gender, and whether you are disabled or your Veteran status.</li>
			<li>If you are participating in a survey, we may ask your gender and age, income, ethnicity, family size and marital status.</li>

		</ul>

<p>
	<strong>Cookies.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	SwiftHog uses cookies, which are small data files created by a website server and stored by your browser, that may be used to recognize users of the Website when they return to the Website, collect usage information and remember users’ preferences. We use cookies to keep track of and enhance certain user activities on our Website such as logging into your account, making a purchase and other user-specific features. We also use cookies to evaluate our web traffic, enhance our communications, and evaluate the effectiveness of our internet-based advertising. See “<span class="underline-text">Interest-Based Behavioral Advertising</span>” below for more information. In addition, your opt-out choices regarding cookies are described in “<span class="underline-text">Opt-Out Choices</span>” below.

</p>

<p>
	<strong>Interest-Based Behavioral Advertising.</strong> 
</p>

<p>
	SwiftHog advertisements are shown on third party websites, including Google. SwiftHog may use technologies such as cookies and web beacons (also known as action tags, pixels, or transparent GIF files) to help manage online advertising. These technologies are provided by one or more third party vendors and enable such vendors to recognize a unique cookie placed by us (when you accessed the Website) or by such vendors, or by another advertiser who works with such vendors. These technologies allow us to learn which advertisements bring users to the Website. They also allow us to collect information about your online activities over time and across third party websites so we can manage advertising effectiveness and provide you with online advertisements, including advertisements on the websites of third parties not affiliated with SwiftHog, more likely to be of interest to you. Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads to you based on your past visits to the Website. With this technology, the information that we collect, process and share is aggregated information or de-identified information that does not identify you individually to other parties.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Opt-Out Choices</strong>
</p>

<p>
	We offer you certain choices about the information we collect, how we use and share information, and how we communicate with you. When you exercise these choices, in order to help protect your privacy, we may take certain steps to verify your identity, such as confirming your ability to verify your email address and certain account information. You also have the following specific opt-out choices:
</p>

<p>
	<i>Emails. </i>
</p>

<p>
	You can opt out of receiving future promotional emails from SwiftHog (such as general marketing emails, rewards or promotional program emails, and customer surveys) by following the unsubscribe procedures indicated in each email. Even if you opt out of receiving promotional emails from SwiftHog, we will send you transaction emails and respond to questions from you.

</p>

<p>
	<i>
		Cookies. 
	</i>
</p>

<p>
	
	You may block or restrict cookies on your computer or device or purge them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences. You should consult the operating instructions that apply to your browser or your mobile device’s user guide for instructions on how to configure your setting to meet your preferences. Because cookies allow you to take advantage of some features or functions of the Website, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you may not be able to use some features of the Website. In addition, disabling cookies may invalidate opt-outs that rely on cookies, such as web analytics or targeted advertising opt- outs.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>
		Interest-Based Behavioral Advertising.

	For information about your choice to opt-out of receiving targeted online advertisements from members of the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), as well as more detailed information about online behavioral advertising, please visit the DAA website at http://www.aboutads.info/choices/. To learn how you can opt-out of Google’s use of cookies, please visit Google’s Ad Settings at: https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads/authenticated. Please note that even if you reject such technology, you may continue to receive advertisements, but the advertising will not be tailored to your browsing activity.

	SwiftHog does not currently respond to DNT signals, but may do so in the future.

</p>

<p>
	<strong>
		Data Retention
	</strong>
</p>

<p>
	In general, we will only retain your personal data for as long as is necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. This means that the retention periods will vary according to the type of the data and the reason that we have the data in the first place. As SwiftHog’s business is subject to federal laws and regulations that include various record-keeping requirements, our data retention practices are designed to comply with such laws.

</p>

<p>
	<strong>
		Accessing and Updating your Personal Information
	</strong>
</p>

<p>
	You may change certain of your personal information in your account online at any time. You may also request changes or corrections to your personal information and privacy preferences by writing us at:

</p>

<p>
	SwiftHog <br>
Re: Website Privacy Policy  <br>
5900 Balcones Drive STE 100  <br>
Austin, TX 78731 <br>
</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>
	By electronic mail: <br>
privacy@swifthog.com

</p>

<p>
	Please include your name, address, and/or email address when you contact us.
</p>

<p>
	You must describe the information in sufficient detail to allow us to locate that information in our records. We may not fulfill a request to change information if we believe the change would violate the law or a legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect. Additionally, some residual information may remain in back-ups, cached, archived or other historical databases. We reserve the right to refuse to modify information if we request proof of identity or authority and the appropriate proof of identity or authority is not provided to us. We do not have the ability to modify or remove third-party records.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>
		Personal Information Removal

	</strong>
</p>

<p>
	You may request that your personal information in your account be deleted under certain circumstances, provided SwiftHog does not have a legitimate or lawful purpose to retain it or is otherwise required by law to retain it. You may make your request by emailing our support team at: privacy@swifthog.com. We may ask you to provide additional information in order to verify your identity before proceeding with your request. Such additional information will be used only for identity verification and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. If such additional information is required and we are unable to contact you with the contact information you have provided, we may be unable to respond to your request. We will work to respond to your request within 45 days from the date of receipt of your request or of all information necessary to proceed with processing the request, as applicable. If you are an individual representing an FFL Dealer doing business with SwiftHog you may contact your account executive directly regarding any requests related to your personal information.

</p>

<p>
	<strong>
		Security
	</strong>
</p>

<p>
	We operate secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems, which are periodically reviewed and enhanced. We do not, however, guarantee that unauthorized or inadvertent disclosure will never occur.

</p>

<p>
	The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with our users is of utmost concern to us. The personally identifiable information you provide to us when you establish an on-line account is protected in several ways. Access by you to your personally identifiable information is available through a password and unique customer ID selected by you. This password is encrypted. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. In addition, your personally identifiable information, whether provided to establish your on-line account or through other Services resides on a secure server that only selected SwiftHog, personnel and contractors have access to via password. We encrypt your personally identifiable information and thereby prevent unauthorized parties from viewing such information when it is transmitted to us.

</p>

<p>
	In order to most efficiently serve you, credit card transactions and order fulfillment are handled by established third party banking, processing agents and distribution institutions. They receive the information needed to verify and authorize your credit card or other payment information and to process and ship your order.
</p>

<p>
	Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. You acknowledge that there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet beyond our control, that the security, integrity and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through the Website cannot be guaranteed, and any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party.  We will notify you of any unencrypted Personal Information that was, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person. The type of information that triggers the notice requirement is an individual's name plus one or more of the following: Social Security number, driver's license or a government issued identifier, financial account numbers, medical information or health insurance information, as well as any complete login information.
